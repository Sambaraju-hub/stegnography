To successfully execute the code please install the following libraries:
OpenCV (cv2): This library is used for image processing, such as reading, writing, and modifying images. In your code, it's used to read the image file and modify pixel values to encode the secret message.
OS: This is a built-in Python library used for interacting with the operating system. In your case, it is used to open the encrypted image file using the default image viewer.
string: Although you imported string, it's not being used in the code, so you can safely remove it.
        This library is typically used to handle string manipulations like creating alphabets or punctuation characters, but it's not necessary in your current code.

Platforms/Software: 
Python
Install Python (if not already installed):
Download from python.org.
OpenCV: You'll need to install the OpenCV library (cv2) using pip. OpenCV is commonly used for computer vision tasks, such as processing images and videos.

To install OpenCV enter the following code: 
pip install opencv-python

 Python IDE/Text Editor: You can run this code in any Python IDE or text editor, such as:
VS Code: A popular code editor with support for Python.
PyCharm: A full-fledged Python IDE.
Jupyter Notebook: If you prefer an interactive environment, though this script is better suited to be run as a standalone script in a Python file (.py).
  Execution: Run the code in a Python environment where OpenCV is installed.
